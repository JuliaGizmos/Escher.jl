# Escher

Escher aims to provide tools to create reactive web-based app in Julia.

These GUIs can be deployed in jupyter notebooks, in the Juno IDE plot pane, in an Electron window or in the browser.

Creating an app in Escher requires three ingredients:

- [Observables](@ref): references that can listen to changes in other references
- [Widgets](@ref): the graphical elements that make up the app
- [Layout](@ref): tools to assemble together different widgets

To get a quick overview of how these tools work together, go to [Tutorial](@ref).
