# Escher

I have stopped developing Escher.jl. However, I am working to take what I learned in developing this package and building reusable and hacking-friendly pieces. See [WebIO.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl) and other packages in the [JuliaGizmos](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos). You should definitely use those instead of trying to use Escher. In the future this package will become available again as a meta package to all the stuff we're building at JuliaGizmos org.
